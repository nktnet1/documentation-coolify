# Documentation Templates

Ready-to-use templates for service documentation. The frontmatter is load-bearing — the generator (`scripts/services-data.mjs`) reads `title`, `description`, `category`, optional `icon`, and optional `disabled` to build the listing.

## Minimal Template

Use for simple services without extensive features or documentation.

**Example:** Ghost, Plausible, simple utilities

```markdown
---
title: "ServiceName"
description: "Short description for the listing card and all.md."
og:
  description: "Optional longer SEO/social-card description."
category: "CMS"
---
