# Adding a new service template to Coolify

Services in Coolify are templates made from normal [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/) files with some added Coolify magic.

::: danger IMPORTANT
The service’s Git repository must have at least 1,000 stars to be added to Coolify as a one click service.
:::

::: info
See [Coolify's docker-compose specs](/knowledge-base/docker/compose#coolify-s-magic-environment-variables) to learn more about Coolify's magic and how to benefit from generated variables and storage handling. Please use this magic when submitting your PR to make the merging process smoother.
:::

1. Add metadata

   At the top of your `docker-compose` file, add the following metadata:

   ```yaml
   # documentation: https://docs.example.com/
   # slogan: A brief description of your service
   # category: One word, broad app type
   # tags: tag1,tag2,tag3
   # logo: svgs/your-service.svg
   # port: 1234
   ```

   - `documentation`: Link to the service's official documentation
   - `slogan`: A short description of the service
   - `category`: A one word broad app type
   - `tags`: Comma-separated list for better searchability
   - `logo`: Path to the service's logo (see step 3)
   - `port`: The main entrypoint port of the service

::: warning Caution
Always specify a port, as Caddy Proxy cannot automatically determine the service's port.
:::

2. Create the docker-compose file

   Below the metadata, add your docker-compose configuration. Use Coolify's environment variable magic [here](/knowledge-base/docker/compose#coolifys-magic-environment-variables).

   Example:

   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       image: your-service-image:tag
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=${COOLIFY_DATABASE_URL}
       volumes:
         - ${COOLIFY_VOLUME_APP}:/data
   ```

   **Using Required Environment Variables:**
   When creating service templates, mark critical configuration as required to improve user experience:

   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       image: your-service:latest
       environment:
         # Required - critical configuration that must be set by the user
         - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL:?}
         - API_KEY=${API_KEY:?}

         # Required with sensible defaults - improves usability
         - PORT=${PORT:?8080}
         - LOG_LEVEL=${LOG_LEVEL:?info}

         # Optional - features that can be left empty
         - DEBUG=${DEBUG:-false}
         - CACHE_TTL=${CACHE_TTL:-3600}
   ```

   This helps users understand which configuration is essential and prevents deployment failures.

3. Add a logo

   - Create or obtain an SVG logo for your service (strongly preferred format)
   - If SVG is unavailable, use a high-quality.webp or JPG as a last resort
   - Add the logo file to the `svgs` folder in the Coolify repository
   - The logo filename should match the docker-compose service name exactly
     - For example, if your service name is `wordpress`, your logo should be `wordpress.svg` and the final path then is `svgs/wordpress.svg` use this path in the `logo` metadata.

4. Test your template

   Use the `Docker Compose Empty` deployment option in Coolify to test your template. This process mimics the one-click service deployment.

5. Submit a Pull Request

   Once your template works correctly:

   - Open a [PR](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/compare)
   - Add your new `<service>.yaml` compose file under `/templates/compose`
   - Include the logo file in the `svgs` folder

   ::: info
   Coolify uses a [parsed version](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/blob/main/templates/service-templates.json) of the templates for deployment.
   :::

## Adding a new service template to the Coolify Documentation

Once your service template is merged into Coolify, it will be important to also add documentation for it in the Coolify docs.
In the [Coolify Docs Contribute section](/get-started/contribute/documentation) we explain how to contribute and run the documentation on your own PC.

::: info HOW THE SERVICE LIST IS BUILT
The services overview page and the [All Services](/services/all) directory are **generated automatically** from the frontmatter of each markdown file in `docs/services/`. You do **not** need to edit `List.vue` or `all.md` manually anymore. The generators run as part of `bun run dev`, `bun run build`, and `bun run preview`.

- `scripts/generate-service-list.mjs` → writes `src/generated/services.json` (consumed by the services overview component)
- `scripts/generate-services-page.mjs` → writes `docs/services/all.md`
- Both scripts share `scripts/services-data.mjs`, which parses each service's frontmatter and resolves its logo from `docs/public/images/services/`
:::

As soon as you have your local setup ready, follow these steps to add your new service:

1. Add the service logo under `/docs/public/images/services/`

   - Use the same base name as your service slug, e.g. `my-service.svg` or `my-service-logo.svg`. The icon resolver tries `<slug>-logo`, `<slug>_logo`, `<slug>logo`, then bare `<slug>`, then the same variants based on the title.
   - Prefer SVG; otherwise WebP, then PNG. Avoid JPEG for logos.

2. Create the documentation file

   Create `/docs/services/<service-slug>.md`. The slug must be lowercase and kebab-case, and must match the filename. Use this frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Service Name"
   description: "Short description that appears on the service card and search results."
   og:
     description: "SEO/social-card description (optional, longer than `description`)."
   category: "Analytics"
   icon: "/docs/images/services/service-name-logo.svg"
   ---
   ```

   | Field | Required | Notes |
   |---|---|---|
   | `title` | yes | Display name shown on the card |
   | `description` | yes | Used as the card description and in `all.md` |
   | `category` | yes | Determines the heading the service appears under in `all.md` and the filter in the overview |
   | `icon` | optional | Only set if auto-resolution can't find your logo |
   | `og.description` | optional | Longer description used for social/SEO meta tags |
   | `disabled` | optional | Set to `true` to hide the service from the listing while keeping the page reachable by direct URL |

3. Write the documentation

   Start writing your documentation under the frontmatter. Use the following template as a starting point:

   ```markdown
   # Service Name

   ![Service Name](/docs/images/services/service-name-logo.svg)

   ## What is Service Name?

   Brief description and use cases.

   ## Links

   - [Official website](https://example.com?utm_source=coolify.io)
   - [GitHub](https://github.com/example/repo?utm_source=coolify.io)
   ```

   Use `<ZoomableImage>` only for screenshots that benefit from a zoomable view, not for the logo.

4. Regenerate the listings (optional — happens automatically on `dev`/`build`)

   ```bash
   bun run generate:services
   ```

   This refreshes `src/generated/services.json` and `docs/services/all.md`. Commit both regenerated files alongside your new service page.

5. Submit a Pull Request

   - Target the `next` branch
   - Verify the service renders correctly with `bun run dev`, including the listing card, the filter category, and the entry in `/services/all`

# Request a new service

If there's a service template you'd like to see in Coolify:

1. Search [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/discussions/categories/service-template-requests) for existing requests.
2. If the service has been requested, upvote it. If not, create a new request.
